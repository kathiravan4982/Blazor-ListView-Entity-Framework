# Blazor-ListView-Entity-Framework

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to help developers understand how to build a **data‑driven Blazor application** using Entity Framework in combination with the Syncfusion [Blazor ListView](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-listview) component. It serves as a reference for binding database content to ListView controls and displaying it in an interactive UI.

## Features
- Integration of **Syncfusion Blazor ListView**
- Data access using **Entity Framework**
- Database‑driven list rendering
- Support for single and multiple item selection
- Hierarchical data presentation in ListView
- Blazor‑based application structure

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following requirements are met before running this project:
- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code
- .NET SDK compatible with the project's target framework
- SQL Server LocalDB (for the sample database)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/Blazor-ListView-Entity-Framework.git
```

### Configure Database Connection
Update the database connection string in the following file:
```bash
Shared/DataAccess/DataContext.cs
```
Example connection string:
```C#
optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(
  @"Data Source=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB;
    AttachDbFilename='D:\Blazor-ListView-Entity-Framework\Shared\App_Data\NORTHWND.MDF';
    Integrated Security=True;
    Connect Timeout=30");
```
Ensure the database file path matches your local environment.

**Visual Studio Code**

1. Open the repository folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the integrated terminal.
3. Navigate to the server project directory:

```bash
cd Server
```

4. Restore the NuGet packages:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

5. Run the project:
